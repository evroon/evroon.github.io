title: About me
---

I'm a MSc Aerospace Engineering student, with a background (BSc) in Physics.

In my free time, I enjoy programming. I try to understand the amazing capabilities of modern GPUs and their shading languages by programming a game engine in C++ and OpenGL.
But next to the low-level programming, I often find myself programming mainstream web and Android development stuff in PHP and Kotlin.
