Build using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and uses the [dark-poole](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole) theme, which is based on the [poole](https://github.com/poole/poole) theme.


## Dark Poole
Dark Poole is a permanent dark theme of the Poole theme by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo). I made the theme darker, inspired by [Derek Kedziora's site](https://derekkedziora.com/). Unlike default Poole that utilizes CSS media queries to activate dark mode, the theme will stay dark regardless of the user's preference.
